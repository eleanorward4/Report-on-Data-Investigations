# Report-on-Data-Investigations

Feb 2024 - Mar 2024

This project involved 2 investigations of data using R Studio coding and producing a report on Latex.
The first was an investigation of daily rainfall and finding an appropriate distribution to model it with using R Studio coding and graphical evidence. 
The second was an investigation on the effectiveness of a new antibiotic through analysing data, using confidence intervals and then evaluating the study.
This project scored 84% and contributed towards my grade in the module "Probability, Statistics and Data".
